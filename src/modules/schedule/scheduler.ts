/**
 * Per-channel scheduler for scheduled tasks (spec D8/D9, ticket T3).
 *
 * One instance per channel, owned by the channel runner. It owns:
 *
 * - the tick loop (default 30 s; spec D8 hot reload by polling) that
 *   re-scans the flat schedules directory through `loadAllTasks` and
 *   re-syncs the in-memory task table, so added/edited/deleted/disabled tasks
 *   take effect on the next tick;
 * - ownership filtering (T2): every scheduler scans all task files, but the
 *   tick fires only tasks whose front-matter `channel` equals this channel's
 *   config name. Tasks owned by other channels and unbound tasks (no
 *   `channel`) are never fired on schedule. The in-memory table still
 *   mirrors every task because target-claiming must resolve any task by
 *   name; fire-time validation additionally refuses tasks bound to another
 *   channel for `/schedule-run` and the timed tick alike;
 * - due-time evaluation (`now >= nextRun`, at most one fire per task per
 *   tick, no bursting) and next-run recomputation (spec D4/D8);
 * - the run registry: one record per run, keyed by the run-unique synthetic
 *   session id, each with its own timeout timer; a run ends when the
 *   scheduler receives its completion signal through
 *   {@link Scheduler.handleOutput} or when the timer fires (spec D5);
 * - firing: a synthetic `command.session.new` (canonical working directory,
 *   `workingDirectorySource: "default"`) followed by a `user.message`, both
 *   carrying a run-unique synthetic `schedule:<task-name>:<yyyymmdd-hhmmss>-<seq>`
 *   clientSessionId (spec D1 / run-history spec D4 — the local-time timestamp
 *   keeps ids unique across restarts, the seq disambiguates same-second
 *   fires), plus fire-time validation of the target and working directory
 *   (spec D6/D7).
 *
 * All external interaction goes through the injected callbacks:
 * `dispatchClientEvent` (synthetic client-output events — the runner wires
 * it to the core's input path), `deliver` (egress events to a task's
 * `target` chat) and `t` (the per-channel translator). The runner diverts
 * `schedule:*` agent output into {@link Scheduler.handleOutput}. This module
 * deliberately knows nothing about the agent adapter or the core; T4/T5 wire
 * it up.
