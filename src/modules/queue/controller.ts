/**
 * Per-channel queue controller (design spec `docs/event-queue-spec.md` D2,
 * ticket T3).
 *
 * One instance per channel, owned by the channel runner next to the
 * scheduler. It owns:
 *
 * - the tick loop (default 30 s, spec D2) that reloads queue definitions on
 *   every tick, so definition edits (`workers`, `model`, `target`) and newly
 *   added queues take effect on the next tick;
 * - ownership filtering: only queues whose front-matter `channel` equals this
 *   channel's config name are consumed; queues owned by other channels (and
 *   their task files) are never touched;
 * - the run registry: one record per run, keyed by the run-unique synthetic
 *   session id `queue:<queue-name>:<task-id>` (spec D1), each with its own
 *   timeout timer set from the queue's `timeout` front matter (5-hour
 *   default, same as scheduled tasks); a run ends when the controller
 *   receives its completion/failure signal through
 *   {@link QueueController.handleOutput} or when the timer fires;
 * - firing: a synthetic `command.session.new` (carrying the queue's pinned
 *   `model` when it has one) followed by a `user.message` whose text is the
 *   queue body plus the task prompt (spec D2). Fire failures are
 *   fail-and-drop (decided): the failure notice goes to the queue's `target`
 *   chat and the task file is deleted.
 *
 * All external interaction goes through the injected callbacks:
 * `dispatchClientEvent` (synthetic client-output events — the runner wires
 * it to the core's input path), `deliver` (egress events to a queue's
 * `target` chat) and `t` (the per-channel translator). The runner diverts
 * `queue:*` agent output into {@link QueueController.handleOutput}. This
 * module deliberately knows nothing about the agent adapter or the core.
